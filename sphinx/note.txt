Pythonista Notes
===================

============
Preface
============
 
This site contains my notes when I learn and work, also through my mistakes in python.

I write this site, before, to keep my notes always on internet, then to share with you my experience. Please note that this site is not a tutorial and does not teach you Python. The topics are not explained in depth, instead only the minimum required information is given. Each topic contains 2 sections, one is very basic information and the other is the pyhon tips, which I found in my work or on internet.

The If you are a beginner or even an intermediate programmer in python, there is something for you in this site. Let's start !!!
